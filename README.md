# DATA-ENCRYPTION-SYSTEM
This project is used for Encrypting and Decrypting data which mainly uses Hybrid Methodology which means uses both Symmetric and Asymmetric Algorithms, Symmetric Algorithm is used for Encrypt and Decrypt data while Asymmetric Algorithm is used for Encrypting and Decrypting key.
